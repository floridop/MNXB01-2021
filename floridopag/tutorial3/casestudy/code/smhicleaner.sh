# Author: Florido Paganelli florido.paganelli@hep.lu.se
#
# Description: this script manuipulates specific SMHI dataset and 
#              performs some cleaning actions on it, namely:
#              - Takes an SMHI datafile <filename> from a specified path in the filesystem
#              - Cleanses up unwanted information in the data file and
#                 extracts just the raw temperature data in
#                 - rawdata_<filename>
#              - prepares the file to be read by standard C++ 
#                CSV libraries
#
# Examples:
#        ./smhicleaner.sh ../data/smhi-opendata_1_52240_20200905_163726.csv
#
# NOTE: the paths above are examples.
# So you should NOT assume the file is exactly in any of the above paths.
# The code must be able to process any possible file path.

# Check that the variable SMHIINPUT is defined, if not,

# Extract the name of the file using the "basename" command 
# basename examples: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basename-command-in-linux-with-examples/
# then store it in a variable DATAFILE

# Write an IF statement that does the following:
# If any of the previous commands failed, exit with error 
# and tell the user what happened.
# remind the user of the syntax by calling the usage() function defined

# Identify the data starting line:
# Looking at the SHMI data, it seems that the line that contains the
# string "Datum" is the beginning of data.
# Find what line contains the string "Datum" using grep
# put the value in a variable called STARTLINE
# - use the grep option -n  and cut to take just the number.
# - use the cut command to select field 1 using ':' as separator
# - Use the pipe | to pass the output of grep to cut
# TODO Examples about the above can be found in Tutorial 3 slide 85
# read also:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6958841/use-grep-to-report-back-only-line-numbers

# Use arithmetic expansion to add a line, since the actual 
# data starts at the STARTLINE + 1 line, so to remove the header
# where Datum;... is contained
# TODO:
STARTLINE=$(( $STARTLINE + 1 ))

# Remove unnecessary lines at the top of the datafile:
# Strip away the top STARTLINE lines (the value of $STARTLINE) using 
# the tail command and write the result 
# to as file called clean1_$DATAFILE using the > operator to 
# redirect the standard output.
# how to exclude n lines with tail : http://heyrod.com/snippets/skip-n-lines.html

# Fix format for the strange lines with comments:
# consider only the relevant columns (1,2,3,4,5) using cut
# this will clean up the lines at the beginning of the data 
# that are not consistent with the format, so that we can use the data 
# these lines contain without discarding them.
# Write the result to a file called clean2_${DATAFILE} using the > operator
